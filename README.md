WSJTeva
==============

This is a module for the topic algorithm, TEvA. It applies the algorithm
to a WSJ Corpus (Wall Street Journal).

It relies on the usage of the Python script "WSJtoCSV.py", located in the
resources folder. Use this script on the WSJ Corpus first to clean it, then
this module can be applied.

Updated README forthcoming, with appropriate citations.
